This study aims to investigate the seasonal variability of POC and its association with Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and wind vector in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) of Bangladesh part, as well as to validate satellite data with in-situ measurement data. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua satellite level-3 data of POC, Chl-a and SST were used in this study. Wind vector data were obtained from WindSat Polarimetric Radiometer satellite. Monthly averaged POC (2002-2019) was ranged from 103.08 to 184.22 mg m-³ with an average of 154.28±31.47 mg m-3. The POC was higher (181.80 ±22.34 mg m-³) during the northeast-monsoon (December-February), and lower (136.56±36.24 mg m-³) in the pre-monsoon (March-May). Statistically significant (F (3,202) =18.09; p&lt;0.05) difference of POC was found among the seasons. A very weak inverse relationship was found between POC and SST whereas POC and Chl-a showed a positive relation for all the seasons in the BoB. This study revealed that the POC was very prominent with the wind vectors prevailing northeasterly in northeast and post monsoon and low with the southwesterly wind in southwest and pre monsoon. POC variability was mostly influenced by Chl-a than SST and wind vector for BoB. Variability of POC in BoB is mainly influenced by monsoon effect which causes tremendous rainfall and strong wind. A significant (p&lt;0.05) moderate correlation (r=0.74) was found between the MODIS Aqua satellite data and in-situ observation. Further detailed investigation is required to observe the association of other parameters with POC variability. "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Objectives of the study", " Chapter 1 Introduction Particulate organic carbon (POC) is one of the most important pools of organic carbon found in the ocean. It takes part in various biological process and influences both organic and inorganic carbon cycles (Liu et al., 2019b) and composed of living materials (Phytoplankton, zooplankton, bacteria, etc.) and detritus. Particulate organic carbon is an important pathway by which organic carbon (formed via photosynthesis) is transferred from the surface to deeper ocean layers where it may be sequestered. It is often used as an indicator of productivity in the euphotic zone (Fingas, 2018). Some zooplankton, such as appendicularians and pteropods, discard gelatinous materials in the surface waters as part of their normal activities. These materials can account for extremely high local POC values in the surface waters (Wangersky, 1977). Although particulate organic carbon (POC) is only 1–10% of dissolved organic carbon (Parsons 1975) in the seawater, the study on POC has become a hot topic of marine sciences because of its importance in marine food chain and marine productivity (Shen, Zhiliang; Yang, Heming &amp; Liu, 2020). One of the main sources of POC input to estuaries is by their associated rivers (Bianchi and Bauer, 2012). On a global scale, rivers deliver approximately 2.0×108 t C/yr. of POC into marginal seas (Liu et al., 2019a). The photosynthetic fixation of inorganic carbon and nutrients into plant biomass is the ultimate source of POC in estuarine and coastal systems. The consumption and transformation of organic matter through metazoan and microbial (e.g., microbial loop) trophic levels are critical in the cycling of POC in estuaries and coastal systems (Bianchi et al., 2007; Wetzel, 1995). POC concentration in ocean is affected by phytoplankton (Fernandes et al., 2009) in association with physical parameters like; light, nutrients, chlorophyll-a concentration, salinity, temperature (Stramska, 2014). Except this, terrigenous POC transported by river discharge (Wang et al., 2012). riverbed erosion (Xu and Milliman, 2009), current (Fan et al., 2018), wind speed and tidal flow (Liu et al., 2019b), SST (Fernandes et al., 2009) also responsible for POC contribution in ocean. Seasonal and annual variations in hydrology, including storm and hurricane events, further influence the input, dispersion, and cycling of POC. Several studies have indicated that remineralization and remobilization also play important roles in controlling POC variation on the shelf (Le et al., 2017). The global ocean surface wind vector (wind speed and direction) field provides essential environmental information. It is critical data for short-term weather forecasts and warnings, nowcasting, climatology, and oceanography studies (Gaiser et al., 2004). Wind can enhance sediment resuspension and vertical mixing (He et al., 2013). So, wind vector is an important factor for the variability of POC concentration in the ocean. POC is composed of suspended particles whose light absorption and back scattering features can be recorded by satellite sensors. (Liu et al., 2019b). The use of satellite-based sensors to estimate POC in the estuary, lakes and global ocean provides numerous advantages with respect to standard field measurement (Le et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2015; Stramski et al., 1999a). The efficiency of satellite measurement depends on the optical characteristics of the water body. There are several satellite systems in operation today that collect imagery that is subsequently distribute POC data to users such as MODIS Aqua (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), Oceansat-2 (OCM-2: Ocean Color Monitor-2) and other satellites which have Chl-a absorption bands like Sentinal-3 (OLCI- Ocean and Land Color Instrument), Landsat 8. Among these, MODIS (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Aqua data is frequently used to estimate the distribution of POC in different parts of world ocean (Duan et al., 2014). Recently, spatial and temporal variability of POC have been studied in Yellow Bohai sea Surface POC is highest in spring (452 ± 53.6 mgm-3) in the Yellow Bohai Sea in China, and lowest in summer (245 ± 84.8 mgm-3) in this sea (Fan et al., 2018). The spatial and seasonal patterns of POC are due to combined influences of primary productivity, water exchange, sediment resuspension and terrestrial inputs. Le et al., (2019) studied POC of two riverbed estuaries in the north Gulf of Mexico. They found that POC concentration may change with changing of season. POC in winter and spring was higher than summer and fall. It also changes with year basis. The highest measured POC occurred in March 2003, with a mean value of 506.1±442.2 mgm-3 and a median value of 353.0 mgm-3. The lowest POC occurred in November 2003, with a mean value of 310.6±324.0 mgm-3. Liu et al., (2015) studied POC distribution in pearl river estuary, China. They found that in situ POC concentrations were ranged between 0.4 mgm-3 and 0.6 mgm-3. The monthly decrease trend of POC concentration was mainly driven by its significant decrease in wet season (May to October) due to low flow velocity, sediment resuspension (Liu et al., 2019a). Many researches work have been done for understanding the variability of POC distribution in different ocean such as Pacific (Fan et al., 2018; Pavia et al., 2019), Atlantic (Stramska, 2014), Southern ocean (Zhu et al., 2011) and global scale (Gardner et al., 2006; Stramska, 2009; Świrgoń and Stramska, 2015). However, little information is available on the distribution of POC in the Indian Ocean (Bhosle et al., 1988) in general, and in the Bay of Bengal (Fernandes et al., 2009; Nandakumar et al., 1987) in particular where the large-scale and long time series data and analysis are insufficient. Remarkably, no study has been conducted yet emphasizing the seasonal variability of POC in the Bangladesh part of BoB. In addition, there is a lack of research on the relationship between changes in POC and other parameters (physical and environmental) in this sea. Satellite data indicate a decrease in the global primary productivity meaning that there is a negative trend in POC in global ocean. The decrease of POC concertation per year could indicate that the biological carbon cycle in the ocean is weakening (Xie et al., 2019). Hence, a baseline study is required to know the level and distribution of POC and associated influencing factors and their level of contribution on the variability which would give us the health status of the marine ecosystems by providing a means for advancing a methodology to diagnose rates and fluxes of relevance to the global carbon cycle and to constrain the uncertainties of carbon budgets. This gap is the motivation of this research to understand more about the seasonal distribution of POC in the BoB and the relationship between POC and other parameters. In the present research, we considered 18 years (2002-2019) POC data value for estimating seasonal variability of POC in the BoB following the data collected from MODIS Aqua satellite. 1.1 Objectives of the study To identify the seasonal trends of POC distribution. Find out season-wise relationship between POC and SST in the BoB. Find out season-wise relationship between POC and Chl-a in the BoB. Find out season-wise relationship between POC and wind vector. To validate the MODIS Aqua satellite-based POC with and in-situ measurements.

Although particulate organic carbon (POC) in the seawater is only 1–10% of dissolved organic carbon , because of its importance in marine food chain and marine productivity, the study on POC has become a hot topic of marine sciences (Shen, Zhiliang; Yang, Heming &amp; Liu, 2020). Particulate organic carbon in seawater includes two (life and non-life) components. Life component includes microbial bacteria, fungi, phage, microorganism photosynthetic plankton, zooplankton, small fish and shrimps and large marine mammals. Non-life part is also known as organic debris, including marine biological activity generated during the wreckage and debris(Zhu et al., 2011). Particulate organic carbon (POC) is an important form of oceanic carbon form, taking part in various biogeochemical processes and influencing both organic and inorganic carbon cycles (Bai et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2019b; Stramski et al., 1999b) 2.2 Abundance of POC in ocean One of the main sources of POC input to estuaries is by their associated rivers. Inputs from rivers will depend on a variety of factors involving both the river itself and the specific estuary (Bianchi and Bauer, 2012). On a global scale, rivers transport about 200 Tg C (Tg=1×1012 g) of terrigenous POC to marginal oceans annually (Wang et al., 2012). The distribution of dissolved, total particulate, and living particulate organic carbon in the surface (0-300 m) and deep ocean (&gt;300m) are varied and summarized in Table 1 (Murray, 2000). Table 2.1 Abundance of POC according to the depth Depth (m) Dissolved (10^6 tonnes C) Approximate concentration (µgC/L) Particulate (10^6 tonnes C) Approximate concentration (µgC/L) 0-300a 110000 1000-1500 11000 100 300-3800b 630000 500-800 13000 3-10 740000c 24000c Total 670000d 14000d 1000000e 30000e a Concentrations vary widely with geographical area and with season. The depth at which the concentration tends to approach a constant level varies widely from 100 to 500 m. b Concentrations more constant. c (Williams, 1971) d (Menzel, 1974) e (Williams, 1975) 2.3 Sources of POC The photosynthetic fixation of inorganic carbon and nutrients into plant biomass is the ultimate source of POC to estuarine and coastal systems. However, these sources may be derived from a vast range of primary producers in aquatic and terrestrial environments (Bianchi, 2007). In addition to autochthonous estuarine sources, inputs of POC to estuaries can occur from a variety of marine, riverine, and terrigenous end members, which may support both estuarine autotrophic and heterotrophic production (Fig. 1). Figure 2.1 : Biogeochemical cycling of nutrients, DOM, and POM, in the estuary proper bound by coastal ocean and riverine end-member exchange (Bianchi and Bauer, 2012) 2.3.1 Terrestrially Derived POC The tectonically driven uplift of marine sedimentary rocks above sea level on the Earth’s surface over geological time produces rock material that can be altered into soils and sediments by weathering processes. Chemical weathering processes in soils are important in the transformation of primary to secondary minerals. Particularly important for the formation of suspended POC in rivers and estuaries is the weathering of feldspars (the most abundant group of minerals in the Earth’s crust), K-feldspar is transformed to kaolinite (a clay) through the following reaction: \\[ \\text{KAlSi}_3\\text{O}_8 + \\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{Al}_2\\text{SiO}_5(\\text{OH})_4 + 2\\text{K}^+ + 4\\text{H}_4\\text{SiO}_4 + \\text{HCO}_3^- \\] where: - KAlSi₃O₈ is K-feldspar, - H₂CO₃ is kaolinite. During the formation of kaolinite, dissolved K+ ion is released from soils, while Al is retained in the solid-phase clay mineral product. Particle–particle and particle–dissolved constituent interactions in river and estuarine systems, have broad-reaching effects on biogeochemical cycling of carbon and other biogenic elements in both dissolved and particulate phases in estuaries because of the strong linkages between the transformation and composition of clay minerals in drainage basin soils and estuarine sediments (Bianchi, 2007). 2.3.2 Estuarine Algal Production Phytoplankton and other primary producers (Fig. 1) represent a quantitatively significant source of POC to most estuaries. Seasonal changes in estuarine phytoplankton abundance and composition are controlled by changes in riverine inputs, nutrients, tidal variability, algal respiration, light availability, horizontal exchanges, and consumption by grazers (Battin et al., 2008; Boyer et al., 1993; Boynton et al., 1982; Cloern, 1996; Lucas and Cloern, 2002; Malone et al., 1988; O’Donohue and Dennison, 1997; Thompson, 1998). Benthic macroalgae and microphytobenthos are also important sources of POC in estuaries (De Jonge and Colijn, 1994; Gould and Gallagher, 1990; Pinckney and Zingmark, 1993; Rizzo et al., 1992; Sullivan and Moncreiff, 1990). However, there is increasing evidence that macroalgae and microphytobenthos may be at least as important as phytoplankton in shallow environments in terms of total biomass and POC production (Cahoon, 2002; Dalsgaard, 2003; Webster et al., 2002). 2.3.3 Submerged and Emerged Aquatic Vegetation Seagrass meadows may also be prominent producers of POC in many shallow littoral habitats in estuarine systems of the South Atlantic Bight (Den Hartog, 1970; Green et al., 2003; Hemminga and Duarte, 2000).The submerged canopy of estuarine seagrass systems has been found to decrease shallow-wave energy, thereby allowing for more efficient trapping of suspended particles and POC derived from both autochthonous and allochthonous sources (Fonseca and Kenworthy, 1987; Ward et al., 1984). Tidal freshwater marshes and mesohaline salt marshes, and mangrove systems have been found to be major sources of primary production and EAV POC in estuarine systems (Fonseca and Kenworthy, 1987; Ward et al., 1984). The global export of POC from mangroves and salt marshes varies significantly between specific systems, but generally ranges between approximately 2–420 and 27–1052 gCM−2 yr−1, respectively (Alongi et al., 1989). 2.4 Environmental factors associated with POC 2.4.1 Chlorophyll Chlorophylls are ubiquitous pigments in the plant kingdom that play a key role in photosynthesis, a vital function for life on Earth (Roca et al., 2016). There are different classes of chlorophylls, major of them are chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and chlorophyll-b (Chl_b). Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is a primary form of chlorophyll used in photosynthesis. It absorbs light energy from wavelengths of violet-blue and orange-red light, and it reflects green/yellow light, thus resulting in the observed green color of most plants. Because it is essential for photosynthesis in plants as well as plankton in the sea, detection of chlorophyll has become a well-established method used by various satellite systems (Fingas, 2018). The phytoplankton abundance played an important role in controlling the concentrations of POC. This was evident from the fairly good significant positive correlations of the concentrations of Chl-a with the concentrations of POC (Fernandes et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2011). 2.4.2 Sea surface temperature (SST) Sea surface temperature (SST) is a strong indicator of productivity, pollution, and global climate change. It has been used to identify sources of pollution, thermal pollution, upwellings, and areas of variant productivity. It is also an indicator of stress to corals and other species (Fingas, 2018). On the landward side of the front, there was a sharp decline in SST as well as an abundance of phytoplankton biomass. On the seaward side of the front, they observed an increase in SST as well as a decrease in the amount of phytoplankton biomass (Kavak and Karadogan, 2011). As chl shows positive relation with POC concentration, POC shows inverse relation with SST. 2.4.3 Reproduction Wild males produce spermatozoa from around 35 g BW and females becomes gravid from 70 g. Mating occurs at night, shortly after moulting, while the cuticle is still soft, and sperm are subsequently kept in a spermatophore (sac) inserted inside the closed thelycum of the female. Females of P. monodon are highly fecund, with gravid individuals producing as many as 500 000 to 750 000 eggs. Spawning occurs at night and fertilization is external, with females releasing sperm from the thelycum as eggs are released in offshore waters. Nauplii hatch 12–15 h after fertilization (FAO, 2018). 2.4.4 Wind speed The global ocean surface wind vector (wind speed and direction) field provides essential environmental information. It is critical data for short-term weather forecasts and warnings, nowcasting, climatology, and oceanography studies(Gaiser et al., 2004). Wind can enhance sediment resuspension and vertical mixing (He et al., 2013). In winter, strong wind strengthens tidal currents, leading to intensive sediment resuspension. POC concentrations were positively correlated with wind speed (Liu et al., 2019a). Water circulation on the inner shelf is primarily driven by wind. Easterly winds prevail during autumn, winter and spring, which drives westerly surface currents along the shelf, and thus, river plume is confined along shelf regions west of the outflows. In the summer, southerly winds reverse the local circulation and promotes an eastward transport of the river plume. A similar effect of wind and surface currents on POC patterns was also found to vary by season (Le et al., 2017). 2.4.5 Water and sediment fluxes Large riverine water flow strengthens water stratification and weakens vertical mixing (Shen et al., 2013). As a result, POC concentration becomes low in the wet season of the outer BoB. On the other hand, basin and riverbed erosion add POC (Xu and Milliman, 2009). 2.4.6 Tidal processes With high water velocity, bottom sediment was resuspended and dispersed to the water surface. As a result, surface POC concentrations were high with high water velocity. Surface POC concentration decreased during the late period of tidal ebbing and early period of tidal flooding with low water velocity; the same pattern was observed during the late period of tidal flooding and early period of tidal ebbing (Liu et al., 2019a). Table 2.2 Other factors associated with POC Name of Factors Relationship with POC References Phytoplankton Positive (Stramska, 2014) Light Positive (Fernandes et al., 2009) Nutrients Positive (Fan et al., 2018) Upwelling Positive (Stramska, 2014) Riverine Water flow Negative (Shen et al., 2013) Riverbed erosion Positive (Xu and Milliman, 2009) Current Positive (Fan et al., 2018) El Nino Negative (Stramska, 2009) 2.5 Trends of POC The spatial and temporal variations of POC in the Yellow-Bohai Sea over 2002–2016 were studied (Fan et al., 2018). A research has been done on satellite observations of seasonal and regional variability of POC concentration in the Barents Sea (Stramska and Bialogrodzka, 2016). Comparison of in situ and satellite ocean color determinations of POC concentration in the global ocean have been done (Świrgoń and Stramska, 2015). Another research for observing POC in global ocean have also been done from SeaWiFS ocean color (Stramska 2009). Seasonal and inter annual variability of particulate organic carbon within the Southern Ocean from satellite ocean color observations have been studied (Allison et al., 2010). Distribution and source analyses of POC in the Yellow and Bohai Sea during summer, 2013 have also been observed (Haibo et al., 2016). A study has been done on spatial and temporal variations of POC sinking flux in global ocean from 2003 to 2018 (Xie et al., 2019). A study has been done for validation and inter comparison of ocean color algorithms for estimating POC in the oceans (Evers-King et al., 2017). A research have been done for finding distribution and sources of POC in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea (Cheng et al., 2011). A different kind of research on POC have been done for investigating remotely sensed detection and application analysis of ocean POC (Cong et al., 2012). Research based on POC have also been done in river and estuary. For example researches have been done for satellite observation of POC dynamics in two river-dominated estuaries (Le et al., 2017) and RS observation of POC in the Pearl River Estuary (Liu et al., 2015) and temporal variability in terrestrially-derived sources of POC in the lower Mississippi River and its upper tributaries have also been studied (Bianchi et al., 2007). Spatial and temporal distribution of particulate organic carbon in Yellow Sea and East China Sea have been studied (Shi et al., 2011). Variability of particulate organic carbon in inland waters have been observed from MODIS Aqua imagery (Duan et al., 2014). A color-index based empirical algorithm for determining POC concentration have been done in the ocean from satellite observations (Le et al., 2018). Satellite-derived POC flux in the Changjiang River through different stages of the Three Gorges Dam have been observed (Liu et al., 2019a). POC and Its composition in Jiaozhou Bay have been obsereved in 2019 (Shen, Zhiliang; Yang, Heming &amp; Liu, 2020). Seasonal and spatial distribution of particulate organic matter in the Bay of Bengal was observed (Fernandes et al., 2009). Few studies related to POC have been found in recent years in BoB but most of the studies focused on the southern (Indian) part of BoB. Therefore, there is a sever scarcity of POC information in the Northen (Bangladesh) part of BoB using satellite data. 2.6 Effect on Marine Life Ocean carbon cycle: Particulate organic carbon (POC) is an important form of oceanic carbon form, taking part in various biogeochemical processes and influencing both organic and inorganic carbon cycles It can sequester carbon, scavenge associated elements and compounds, and sink to the deep ocean as part of the “biological pump”. Land and ocean ecosystems, which are the two largest active carbon reservoirs in the world, are connected by rivers (Bai et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2012). POC in the ocean is also added through local phytoplankton production, flocculation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and sediment resuspension, etc. Oceanic POC can also be removed through trans formation of POC to DOC, microbial respiration, and particle deposition, etc. Due to these physical and biogeochemical properties, investigating the variations in marine POC using in-situ data from ships or other platforms remains challenging (Liu et al., 2019a). Under the influence of the East Asian monsoon, Asian river watersheds are characterized by high POC yields (Ludwig et al., 1996). POC concentration in summer is usually higher than that in winter. 2.7 Estimation of POC POC is measured from both in situ (ship base) and satellite data. In ship base-based management, There are many analytical methods for the measurement of POC distribution (Biddanda and Benner, 1997; Knap et al., 1996; Parsons et al., 1984; Sharp, 1974). Among the most used method for the POC estimation is the spectrophotometric method and this is done for the validation of remote sensing data (Parsons et al., 1984). Water samples will be collected from different location of Bay of Bengal with the help of Bangladesh Navy. Then it will be immediately filtered through pre-combusted (1000C 1h) 47mm NCF/C (0.45µm pore size) nitrocellulose filter. Filters will be stored at -200C until the analysis will be completed. Particulate matter left on the filters will be analyzed for POC. As the filters will not be pre-weighed, suspended matter could not be determined on these samples. POC will be analyzed spectrophotometrically after wet oxidation of carbon by acid dichromate (Parsons et al., 1984). POC is composed to suspended particles whose light absorption and back scattering features can be recorded by satellite sensors. (Liu et al., 2019b). The use of satellite-based sensors to estimate POC in the estuary, lakes and global ocean provides numerous advantages with respect to standard field measurement(Le et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2015; Stramski et al., 1999a). The efficiency of satellite measurement depends on the optical characteristics of the water body. There are several satellite systems in operation today that collect imagery that is subsequently distribute POC data to users such as MODIS Aqua (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) (Duan et al., 2014), SeaWiFS (Stramska, 2009), The Visible and Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite including the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (VIIRS-SNPP) (Lee et al., 2019). MODIS (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Aqua data is frequently used to estimate the distribution of POC in different parts of world ocean (Evers-King et al., 2017; Gardner et al., 2006; Le et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019a, 2019b; Zibordi and Mélin, 2017). 2.8 MODIS Aqua Satellite The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), is a 36-band spectroradiometer measuring visible and infrared radiation and obtaining data that are being used to derive products ranging from vegetation, land surface cover, and ocean chlorophyll fluorescence to cloud and aerosol properties, fire occurrence, snow cover on the land, and sea ice cover on the oceans.

WindSat, the first space-borne multifrequency polarimetric microwave radiometer, has been developed by the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) to demonstrate that ocean surface wind vectors can be derived from space using a passive instrument. The resolution of the winds is defined by the lowest frequency channel. Although not a scatterometer, it is useful for monitoring purposes to treat it as such due to the ambiguity present in the wind vectors. The WindSat radiometer is well-calibrated and contains the lower frequency channels required for SST retrievals. The radiometer operates in 5 discrete channels: 6.8, 10.7, 18.7, 23.8 and 37.0 GHz. All are fully polarimetric except the 6.8 and 23.8 GHz channels that have only dual polarization. Table 4 summarizes the channel details. The feedhorns of each frequency channel trace out different arcs along the scan, therefore the Earth Incidence Angles (EIA) are different for each frequency band. Unlike previous radiometers, the WindSat sensor takes observations during both the forward and aft looking scans. This makes the WindSat geometry of the earth view swath quite different and significantly more complicated to work with than the other passive microwave sensors. The RSS WindSat products are the only dataset available that uses both the fore and aft look directions. By using both directions, we obtain a wider swath and more complicated swath geometry as is visible in the browse images (Gaiser et al., 2004).

It is bounded in the west by the east coasts of Sri Lanka and India, on the north by the deltaic region of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river system, and on the east by the Myanmar peninsula extended up to the Andaman-Nicobar ridges (Banglapedia, 2014). The recent two verdicts of maritime boundary of Bangladesh with Myanmar and India, allowed the country to exercise sovereign right to 118,813 sq. km of waters extending up to 12 nautical miles of territorial sea and a further Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of 200 nautical miles into the sea and continental shelf extending up to 354 nm from the Chittagong coast (Hussain et al., 2017). This award allowed Bangladesh to establish sovereign rights over the living and non-living resources of BoB territorial waters. Fig. 1 shows the present maritime boundary of Bangladesh. The BoB is featured with a humid monsoon climate with moderate rainfall 1638-3558 mm and air temperatures 19-33° C prevail in the coastal belt. SST varies from 22.8-32.9° C in the BoB. The surface salinity varies from 10-29 ppt and increases rapidly within the upper depth of 20-30 m. The primary productivity of BoB is very rich during the northeast monsoon (NEM), 0.15-1.45cm2 day-1. Figure 2.2 : Maritime area of Bangladesh (MoFA 2014) 2.11 Seasons of Bangladesh Bangladesh has a subtropical seasonal monsoon, characterized by wide seasonal variations in rainfall, moderately warm temperatures, and high humidity. Based on monsoon, four seasons are recognized such as pre-monsoon (March, April, and May), southwest monsoon (June to September), post-monsoon (October and November) and northeast monsoon or winter (December, January, and February). Southwest monsoon is the most important feature of controlling the climate of Bangladesh. More than 71% of the annual rainfall is received during this season. Variability in the onset, withdrawal of monsoon and rainfall during the monsoon season has profound impacts on fisheries, water resources, power, agriculture, and ecosystems, in Bangladesh. On the other hand, in the winter season, the temperature falls and causing a decrease in SST. The brief characteristics of four seasons are given below: Winter or Northeast Monsoon (December - February) This season is characterized by very light northerly winds, mild temperature, dry weather, and lower SST. It is also known as the winter season. The mean temperature is in the range of 18- 22° C and SST 24-26.7° C. Only 2% of the annual total rainfall occurs in this season (Khatun et al. 2016). During winter season, the northeasterly winds prevail over the country blowing from land to sea except northern hilly areas where mainly easterly wind prevails. But during the passage of upper air cyclonic circulation over northwestern part of the country (called western disturbances) light rain occurs over the country (Khatun et al., 2016). Summer or Pre-Monsoon (March-May) The mean temperature of Bangladesh during the summer months varies between 23-30 °C and SST 26.50-30.80 °C. April and May are the hottest months of a year. The highest maximum temperature ranging from 36-40oC is attained in the northwestern and southwestern districts. Low-pressure results in the formation of thunder cloud and the development of severe thunderstorms. Only 19 % of the total annual rainfall occurs in this season. This season is also characterized by cyclogenesis in the BoB. Some of the low pressure formed over the BoB intensified into a depression and turned into a cyclonic storm. They are occasionally associated with storm surges and causes of high causalities and damages. Thunderstorms are very common during this season over the country. In this season, localized thunderstorms associated with violent winds, torrential downpours and occasionally hail occur. These are locally known as the ‘Kalbaishakhi’ are the common weather phenomena (Khatun et al., 2016). Southwest Monsoon (June - September) In this season, the surface wind changes to southwesterly/southerly direction. Wind speed remains light to moderate. The onset and withdrawal of monsoon vary from year to year and place to place. SST is ranged from 28 to 30.50° C. In general, rain with widespread cloud coverage and high humidity are the characteristics of this season. More than 71 % of the total annual rainfall occurs in this season. Monsoon depression forms over the BoB during this season. They generally move northwestwards and cross the Indian coast. Some of them move towards Bangladesh coasts and caused heavy rainfall. Depressions seldom attain into cyclone state in this season (Khatun et al., 2016). Post-Monsoon (October - November) This is the transitional season from summer monsoon to the winter. Rainfall decreases considerably during October and November. Only 8% of the annual total rainfall occurs in this season (Khatun et al., 2016). Temperature falls noticeably. SST is ranged from 27.50 to 30.50°C. Cyclonic disturbances from over the BoB during this season (Khatun et al., 2016). 2.12 Satellite Imagery POC in coastal margin environments typically occurs in complex systems where most features vary dramatically in time and space. Over short timescales (e.g., hours to days), this variability limits the utility of shipboard in situ measurements for mapping the spatial concentration and flux of materials in coastal margins. Although data obtained from satellites can provide some of the routine, synoptic information required to study these complex environments, commensurate shipboard measurements are frequently needed to translate remote-sensing imagery to meaningful biogeochemical parameters and to facilitate process-based studies. In addition, remote sensing affords the ability to extend potentially locally derived information to regional and global scales (Bianchi and Bauer, 2012). Ocean color is the primal facet in ocean monitoring as it is the basis for several other forms of detection. Ocean color is strongly influenced by adsorption and reflection or scattering of light at the water’s surface. Light in the red wavelengths is strongly absorbed by uncontaminated water, making the oceans appear blue. Some of this blue light is reflected and can be used by remote sensors to categorize targets. Particles or objects will scatter the light enabling these to be detected. This is the basis of much of the work that has been using ocean color. Further, any applications of the use of color must be subject to certain criteria to enable its use for certain facets of environmental studies, and several researchers have studied the oceans and mapped out areas where sensor calibrations can suitably be conducted (Fingas, 2018) . 2.13 Remote Sensing Remote sensing (RS) is an art or science of telling something about an object without touching it. Remote sensing of the marine environment began in the mid-20th century with the use of cameras and acoustic sensors to characterize the target. This has grown to satellites dedicated to the task of delineating various aspects of the marine environment. RS collect data by detecting the energy level that is reflected from Earth. Radiation that is emitted or reflected by the object or water body, is recorded by sensors. These sensors can be on satellites or mounted on aircraft (NOAA 2017). Light from the sun reflects on the water body and directed satellite sensors (passive RS). At that time, the possible interactions are absorption and scattering by the water constituents; reflection, and absorption by the sea surface; reflection and refraction at the water/air interface; and absorption and scattering the atmosphere (Fig. 3). The success of the applications of RS is improved considerably by taking a multiple view approach to data collection i.e. data can be taken either by multistage sensing (data about a site are collected from multiple altitudes) or multispectral sensing (data are acquired simultaneously in several spectral bands) or multi- temporal sensing (data are collected on more than one occasion).

Gridded monthly wind data were collected from the WindSat Polarimetric Radiometer satellite that has 5 discrete bands of Asia Asia-Pacific Data Research Center (APDRC) of NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) (http://apdrc.soest.hawaii.edu/) from January 2003 to December 2019 (Table 5). Bangladesh is in the sub-tropical monsoon climate regime. Based on the considered climate of this country (Khatun et al., 2016), four seasons are recognized as- pre-monsoon (March, April and May), southwest monsoon (June to September), post-monsoon (October and November) and northeast monsoon (December, January and February) in this study. 3.3 Data properties The output unit of particulate organic carbon (POC) is mgm-3, calculated using an empirical relationship derived from in situ measurements of POC and blue-to-green band ratios of remote sensing reflectance’s (Rrs) on the availability of bands centered at 443 nm in the blue region and between 547 and 565 nm in the green region (Stramski et al., 2008). The algorithm is a power law relationship between a ratio of Rrs and POC: \\[ POC = a \\times \\left( \\frac{{Rrs(443)}}{{Rrs(553)}} \\right)^b \\] Where: \\(a = 203.2\\) \\(b = -1.034\\) Relationships between the surface concentration of particulate organic carbon and optical properties are discussed detail by (Stramski et al., 2008). The output unit of the Chl-a value is mgm-3. The Chl-a product combines two algorithms, the O’Reilly band ratio OCx (e.g. chl_oc4) algorithm and the Hu color index (CI)algorithm (chl_hu). For Chl-a retrievals below 0.15 mgm-3, the color index (CI) algorithm is used. For Chl- a retrievals above 0.2 mgm-3, the OCx algorithm is used. In between these values, the CI and OCx algorithm are blended using a weighted approach (NASA, 2014a). Sea surface temperature (SST) in units of °C (degree Celsius) using the 11um and 12um long wave infrared bands. The algorithm is based on a modified version of the nonlinear SST algorithm of Walton et al., (1998) and is applicable to both MODIS and VIIRS sensors for daytime and nighttime observations (NASA, 2014b). Here, daytime 11 um data were used to analyze SST value. In case of monthly wind vector data (2003-2019), 10-meter surface wind speed - all weather (m/s) and 10-meter surface wind direction- relative to north (deg) were taken for the investigation of wind on POC image seasonally. Detail data properties are presented in Table 5.

This software is capable to rasterize the standard mapped image (SMI) level-3 satellite image. After rasterization, the image was cropped according to our study area and obtained the statistical information (maximum value, minimum value, mean, median, standard deviation etc.) using ‘Display Statistics’ tool. WindSat data were analyzed using ArcGIS 10.4 Software which processes the raster images of wind speed and direction into vector form by ‘Make netCDF Feature Layer’ of ‘Multidimensional tools’. After the vector data formation, the layer properties of the data in the study area were symbolized by arrow sign. Then the monthly POC data were opened in ArcGIS 10.4 and cropped the selected study area (BoB) by the tool of ‘Extract by mask’ and overlapped on the POC image. 3.5 In-situ measurement In-situ POC was estimated following the method prescribed by Parsons et al., (1984). Special apparatus and equipment and regents are listed in Annex I. Sample collection: Samples were collected from twelve different sampling stations from latitude 20°00’37.32” N to 21° 10’8” N along about 89° 28’ E to 89° 32’ longitude with a 3’ (3 min) geographic coordinate (Fig. 1) interval on 2,6 December, 2019 during daytime (8 am-3.30 pm) with BNS Turag, a Ship of Bangladesh Navy. Water samples were collected using non-toxic opaque sampler from the depth of 0.5 m and stored in opaque bottles (1-liter high-density polyethylene sample bottles). Filtration: Filtration was carried out within one hour of collection of the sample with a vacuum pump. Nitrocellulose filter of 47 mm diameter and 0.45 µm pore size was used. After filtration of a suitable sample of seawater (usually 0.5 L), full suction to the filter was applied. Releasing the suction after 1 min, 2 ml of sodium sulfate reagent was added, and it was reapplied the suction immediately by adding 2 ml of sodium sulfate once again and the filter under suction was removed. Filtration volume was recorded for each filter and after filtration, filter papers were folded half and wrap in prelabeled aluminum foil and placed in a freezer. The samples were then shifted to the water quality laboratory of Fisheries and Marine Resource Technology Discipline of Khulna University. The laboratory analysis for estimating POC is described below: Placing the filter in a 30-ml beaker and pressing it into the bottom. Add 1.0 ml of phosphoric acid and 1.0 ml of distilled water. Mix and place it on a hot plate at 100°C for 30 min, covered with a watch glass. Add 10 ml sulfuric acid-dichromate oxidant and 2 ml distilled water. Mix the solution by swirling and place a cover glass over each beaker. Place it on a hot plate for 60 min at 100°C. Cool the mixture; transfer the solution and glass fiber filter to a suitably sized graduated cylinder. Rinse the sides of the beaker with distilled water. Make up the volume with distilled water in the graduated cylinder. Stopper and mix by inverting; allow it to stand at room temperature to cool and to allow the filter to settle at the bottom of the cylinder. Measure the extinction of a blank solution against the sample at 440 nm using a 1cm cuvette path length. Correct the resulting extinction for the absorbance of trivalent chromium by the expression: \\[ E = 1.1 \\times E_f \\] Where: \\(E\\): Extinction for trivalent chromium \\(E_f\\): Extinction difference between the sample and blank solution. Estimate POC in mgm\\(^{-3}\\) using the following formula: \\[ POC (\\mu g/l) = \\frac{{E \\times F \\times v}}{{V}} \\] Where: \\(F\\): Calibration factor = 275 \\(V\\): Volume of seawater filtered in liters \\(v\\): Volume of oxidant. 3.6 Data analysis All statistical analyses including correlation, regression, one-way ANOVA and post-hoc test was performed using R- studio and SPSS.

Therefore, monsoon has a major influence on POC variability over the BoB. So, understanding the seasonal POC variability helps us to reveal the effects of monsoon on POC variability. The seasonal pattern of POC in the BoB is illustrated by climatological monthly composites of the MODIS-aqua images from July 2002 to June 2019 (Fig. 4.2). In this Figure, a month represents the average value of the same month for all the years from 2002 to 2019. Monthly averaged POC was ranged between 103.08 and 184.22 mgm-3. Northeast-monsoon (December-February) showed the highest (181.80 ±22.34 mgm-³) POC. From that, a small reduced concentration was observed during two monsoon seasons, i.e., post-monsoon (October-November) (162.33±28.16 mgm-³) and Southwest Monsoon (June- September) (141.31 ±36.40 mgm-³). Lowest POC (136.56±36.24 mgm-³) was found during pre-monsoon (March-May) particularly in the month of May (115.38±41.31 mgm-³) (Fig. 4.1).

Figure 4.2 : MODIS derived monthly climatology of POC from July 2002 to June 2019 in the BoB 4.2 Seasonal relation between SST and POC SST was ranged from 24.02 0 C to 30.83 0 C (2002-2019) among the seasons in the study area. An inverse relation was found between SST and POC for all the seasons in the BoB. The regression coefficient (b) between SST and POC was high (-15.86) in Southwest Monsoon (June- September) and low (-6.81) in northeast-monsoon (December-February) (Fig. 8). Statistically significant relation between SST and POC was found in southwest monsoon and pre-monsoon (p&lt;0.05) whereas no significant (p &gt;0.05) relation was found in northeast monsoon and post-monsoon.

The regression coefficient (b) between Chl-a and POC was highest (78.01) in northeast-monsoon (December-February) and lowest (40.68) in pre-monsoon (March-May) (Fig. 4.4). Statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) relation between the Chl-a and POC was found in all the seasons. The correlation coefficient (r) was ranged from 0.64 to 0.87 (Fig. 4.4).

The regression coefficient (b) between wind speed and POC were 4.11, 1.63, -7.51 and -7.4 in southwest monsoon (July-September), Northeast monsoon (December-February), pre and post monsoon respectively (Fig. 4.5).

Figure 4.5 : MODIS derived Seasonal relationship between Wind speed and POC from July 2002 to June 2019 Monthly wind speed range was 3.8-9.0 ms-1 in January representing northeast monsoon, 5.0-10.6 ms-1 in May,7.6-13.4 ms-1 in July and 3.6-10.0 ms-1 in October representing pre-monsoon, southwest monsoon and post monsoon respectively. POC was very high with the wind vectors prevailing northeasterly wind in northeast monsoon (January 2019) and post monsoon (October 2019) compared to other seasons. In southwest monsoon (July 2019) and pre-monsoon (May 2019), prevailing southwesterly winds in may have contributed to low POC in the inner, middle and outer shelves. The circulation winds October of post monsoon may have contributed to high POC in the inner shelves of the BoB (Fig. 4.6). Figure 4.6 : WindSat derived Seasonal relationship between POC and wind vector in 2019 4.5 In-situ validation In-situ POC measurement ranged from 62.92 to 162.14 mgm-3 and are shown in Table 8.

Fernandes et al. (2009) also observed the concentration of POC from 51.6 to 133.2 mgm-3 in the BoB. The observed seasonal differences in POC appears to be governed by river run-off and physical forces such as eddies which pump nutrients into the surface waters thereby enhancing biological production (Fernandes et al., 2009). The seasonal variability of POC was significant in the northern BoB in this study. Fernandes et al., (2009) also observed the significant difference of POC variability among the seasons in both offshore and near stations of the BoB due to nutrient addition by organic matter production. Similar result was found by Allison et al., (2010) in the southern ocean. 5.1.1 Southwest monsoon (June – September) Among the seasons, reasonably low POC was observed in this season (141.31 ±36.40 mgm-³). Highest SST was recorded (30.58 0C) at the beginning of this seasons and responsible for this lower POC. Insufficient freshwater influx can also be a major cause for the lower range of POC (Nagamani et al., 2011). As surface water warms because of high SST, the stratification being pronounced, mixing is suppressed, and transfer of nutrients is decreased from deeper to surface waters. Therefore, phytoplankton productivity declines and POC becomes low (Stramska and Bialogrodzka, 2016). In southwest monsoon, prevailing southwesterly winds may have contributed to low POC in the inner, middle and outer shelves. Similar observation was also reported by Liu et al., (2015). 5.1.2 Post Monsoon (October- November) Beginning of post monsoon POC starts to rise (Fig. 4.1). Relatively high POC (162.33±28.16 mgm-³) was observed in this season than the southwest monsoon because the wind forces the nutrient rich water to reach the surface for phytoplankton cells to grow (Sarangi and Devi, 2017). Gomes et al., (2000) supported the wind driven coastal upwelling and increased river runoff during the southwest monsoon increased phytoplankton biomass dramatically which cause the enhance of phytoplankton productivity during post monsoon season. The BoB is featured with several cyclones in this season (Sarangi et al., 2008), which provide nutrient rich subsurface water to the surface, form eddies and intensify blooms (Chauhan et al., 2002; Madhu et al., 2002) and consequential roles in formation of POC. 5.1.3 Northeast Monsoon (December- February) POC has found highest (181.80 ±22.34 mgm-³) during northeast monsoon characterized by very light northeasterly winds, mild temperature, dry weather, and lower SST (24.02 0C). Phytoplankton blooms patches generally occurred in this season (December to January) and disappear in the later months over the BoB. The blooms in this season are mainly attributed to the ocean upwelling driven Ekman pumping. Sarangi and Devi (2017) observed high nitrate dispersion on a synoptic scale during December and January. This nitrate is related to upwelling and convection processes which bring up the deeper and subsurface nutrient rich water to the surface during northeast monsoon. The winter convection process which brings nutrient rich water to the surface is responsible for the enhanced biological production (Tang et al., 2010). Highest POC of the BoB is mostly derived from phytoplankton (Fernandes et al., 2009). High POC (380 ± 28.7 mgm-³) was also accorded in northeast monsoon in the Yellow-Bohai sea of China (Fan et al., 2018). 5.1.4 Pre-Monsoon (March – May) Lowest POC (136.56±36.24mg m-³) was found during pre-monsoon (March-May) particularly in the month of May (115.38±41.31mg m-³) in BoB (Fig. 4.1). The gradual increase in SST results low POC on the BoB in this season and this relation was confirmed by previous studies (Nagamani et al., 2011).This increase of SST and decrease of wind speed. Insufficient freshwater influx can also be a reason for lower POC because fresh water influx causes high productivity by making the waters of the upper layer less saline and highly stratified (Nagamani et al., 2011). Reduction of POC in pre-monsoon due to removal process or dilution was also observed by Fan et al., (2018). 5.2 Relationship between POC and SST Recent evidence indicating that the variability of POC is negatively correlated with SST (Yu et al., 2019). An inverse relation was found between SST and POC for all the seasons in the BoB. The coefficient of regression was high (b= -15.86) in Southwest Monsoon (June- September) and low (b= -6.81) in northeast-monsoon (December-February) (6.81) (Fig.4.3). In northeast monsoon, we observed low negative coefficient. This scenario has been supported in the past by in situ observations in the Barents sea, Norway (Stramska and Bialogrodzka, 2016) and North Atlantic (Marra et al., 2015). In contrast, in the southwest monsoon (June- September) water becomes warm in the study area. The warm sea surface temperature (SST’s) and the low salinity in the Bay of Bengal lead to strong stratification of the water column, which prevents the transport of nutrient rich bottom waters into the surface (Fernandes et al., 2009). Therefore, phytoplankton productivity declines which results a high negative correlation between SST and POC during this season. 5.3 Relationship between POC and Chl-a Phytoplankton production is the primary or main source for POC in the open ocean surface waters (Siegel et al., 2013; Stramska, 2009; Stramski et al., 2008, 1999a; Yoder and Kennelly, 2006). Statistically a moderate positive significant relation was found between Chl-a and POC in all the seasons where the regression coefficient was ranged from 40.68 (pre-monsoon) to 78.01 (northeast monsoon). A significantly positive but relatively lower correlation coefficient (0.64–0.87) between POC and Chl-a (Fig. 4.4). Similar result was also found by Yu et al., (2019) in the North Pacific Ocean. Fernandes et al., (2009) also observed a fairly good significant positive relationship between POC and Chl-a was also reported by in the BoB. Strong correlation between POC and Chl-a reveal that POC mostly derived from phytoplankton, not terrestrial organic matter to a great extent (Fernandes et al., 2009). The relation between POC and Chl-a was low (b = 40.68) in pre-monsoon, indicating that phytoplankton was relatively less dominant source of particulate carbon in these waters (Duan et al., 2014) and high (b=78.01) in northeast monsoon suggesting that POC is intensively regulated by marine phytoplankton in association with nutrient loading from riverine inputs (Liu et al., 2019a). 5.4 Relationship between POC and wind vector Water circulation on the inner shelf is primarily driven by wind (Nowlin et al., 2005). The monthly mean POC was weakly correlated with monthly wind speed (Fig. 4.5) among the seasons. Similar result was found by Le et al. (2017) on the Louisiana Continental Shelf (USA). POC distribution is associated with wind direction. High POC distribution was found in northeast and post monsoon seasons when the prevailing wind was northeasterly direction. Low POC distribution was found southwest and pre-monsoon seasons when the prevailing wind was in southwesterly direction (Fig. 4.6). Similar pattern was reported by Liu et al., (2015). Northeasterly winds prevail during winter, which drives westerly surface currents along the shore. In northeast monsoon, strong wind strengthens tidal currents, leading to intensive sediment resuspension. POC concentrations were positively correlated with wind speed (Liu et al., 2019a). Surface POC concentrations were high with high water velocity that were association with wind. Surface POC concentration decreased during the late period of tidal ebbing and early period of tidal flooding with low water velocity; the same pattern was observed during the late period of tidal flooding and early period of tidal ebbing (Liu et al., 2019a). 5.5 Validation of MODIS Aqua derived POC In-situ POC measurement ranged from 62.92 to 162.14 mgm-3 and are shown in Table 5. The correlation coefficient (Fig. 4.7) between in-situ and MODIS-Aqua satellite-derived POC was 0.74 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 38.15% and mean relative error (MRE) of 32.17 % (Fig. 4.7). Lower values of RMSE indicate better fit of the of the model to the data representing how close the observed data points are to the model’s predicted values (Yu et al., 2019). Le et al. ( 2017) observed a similar performance as on the Louisiana Continental Shelf (LCS) in USA with R2=0.64, MRE=36.9%, and RMSE=49.8% using MODIS Aqua imagery. Duan et al. (2014) also observed a strong relationship between in-situ measured POC and MODIS estimated POC (N=16, RMSE=44.46%) using POC algorithm for the Yangtze River, China. General sources of error associated with any ocean-color product include differences introduced by choice of sensor, sensor calibration, and the atmospheric correction procedure used to retrieve remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) (Evers-King et al., 2017). Further understanding of the sources of variability between POC and optical parameters can then be incorporated into future, semi-analytical algorithms. New understanding of these relationships may also inform future sensor development (e.g., hyperspectral sensors) and optical modeling technique (Evers-King et al., 2017). 5.6 Relation with distance A negative relation (-0.18) between the in-situ POC and distance with depth was found in the study area (Fig. 4.8). POC was decreasing from the lower depth area i.e., shelf zone (100-300m) to the higher depth area i.e., deep ocean. Similar result was observed in Fig.4.2 illustrated the raster image of multiyear monthly data. Because The primary productivity of phytoplankton is negatively correlated with the depth (Stramska, 2014). The observed decrease with depth of POC indicates heterotrophic uptake and/or dilution by inorganic material which results poor POC (Fernandes et al., 2009). So, phytoplankton distribution is mainly responsible for the phenomenon in the Bay of Bengal. The euphotic depth variability was also accountable for the vertical distribution of POC (Liu et al., 2015). "],["conclusion-and-recommendation.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion and Recommendation 6.1 Conclusion 6.2 Recommendation", " Chapter 6 Conclusion and Recommendation 6.1 Conclusion From the present study the following conclusions can be drawn- Highest POC was observed during the northeast monsoon, while the lowest was recorded during pre-monsoon months. Monthly POC exhibited an inverse relationship with monthly Sea Surface Temperature (SST), with SST having almost no contribution to the variability of POC in the Bay of Bengal. A positive correlation was found between Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and POC in the Bay of Bengal. POC variability was primarily influenced by Chl-a rather than SST, indicating that Chl-a has the greatest contribution to the variation of POC. No statistically significant difference was observed between wind speed and POC (p &gt; 0.05). POC levels were notably high when the prevailing wind vectors were northeasterly and low during southwesterly winds. A moderate positive correlation was identified between in-situ POC values and POC values derived from MODIS-Aqua satellite data. There was a negative correlation between in-situ POC and depth in the Bay of Bengal. POC demonstrated a decreasing trend from the shelf zone to the deep ocean. 6.2 Recommendation The spatial resolution of MODIS-Aqua satellite is very high. Low-resolution data may provide a more accurate estimation of POC. It is essential to develop a regional algorithm tailored for the best measurement of POC. This will contribute to more accurate and context-specific assessments. There is a need for additional facilities to support more intense in-situ field measurements. Increasing the sampling number will enhance the reliability of the collected data for a comprehensive analysis of POC. Further studies are crucial to address the multitude of factors responsible for POC variability. Understanding these factors will contribute to a more comprehensive and nuanced comprehension of the dynamics influencing POC in the studied region.
